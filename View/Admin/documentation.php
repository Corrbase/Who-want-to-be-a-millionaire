                The game is meant to be played with your whole audience or a bigger group of people, not just one contestant. This is the reason why the money indicator
                goes up after every question: there will always be people who get the answer right, just like there will be some who get it wrong. Either way, the game
                is designed to be played until the end, so participants answer all 15 questions and the game ends at 1.000.000$. Counting the right answers has to be done
                manually for now. However, soon it will be possible to count the correct answers per attendee automatically, and show an overall ranking at the end.
